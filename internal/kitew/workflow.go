// deployWorkflow is the GitHub Actions workflow `kite init` writes, and

//
// It is a file in the repository rather than something Kite talks to over an
// API. Deployment belongs to the hosting platform, and a workflow the author
// can read, edit and delete is the honest shape for that: changing host means
// editing this file, not migrating a CMS.
//
// It builds with kitew, which runs the release kite.lock pins: the one that
// wrote the project, until the author moves the pin. A workflow that floated
// to the newest release would rebuild the same commit differently later,
// which is the thing reproducible builds exist to prevent.
//
// Its last job pings the update services the site lists once the deploy is
// live. It is its own job, allowed to fail, so a service that is down never
// fails a deployment.
